     <b>Overview</b> 
     <ul>
      The ensembles, moves, and force fields that power Towhee come from a wide variety of sources.  This section discusses how to use the
      towhee_citations output file as a starting place for acknowledging the contributions of others when writing up the results of your own research.
      <p></p>
      This manual lists the references that are suggested in the towhee_citation file for each ensemble or Monte Carlo algorithm along with commentary 
      on why those were chosen as the preferred references, and also sometimes includes a discussion about other papers that are relevant and also worth
      considering.

         This is the original Monte Carlo  molecular simulation paper.  While the system simulated was very primitive by modern standards (2-dimensional hard
         disks), they presented the general algorithm that is the basis for all subsequent Monte Carlo molecular simulations.  Also the first use of the
         translation move (the only move required to sample the Canonical ensemble for monatomic molecules).

         While this article was not known in the western literature until much later, it is the first paper describing the Grand Canonical ensemble
         using the Monte Carlo method for continuous potentials.

        <a href="references.html#rowley_et_al_1975">Rowley <i>et al.</i> 1975</a> <i>additional reference</i>
        <dt>
         Among the first publications in the western literature to present an algorithm and results for the Grand Canonical creation/removal
         move for continuous potentials.  However, their method of keeping ficticious atoms in the system and transitioning them between 
         real and imaginary is not the method used in Towhee for performing the insertion/deletion.

         The original Gibbs ensemble paper.  Contains a derviation for the moves required for the NVT-Gibbs ensemble using arguments based upon
         the fluctuation theorm of Landau and Lifshitz.  Despite the atypical starting place for deriving ensemble acceptance rules the only 
         equation that does not agree with later work is the molecule transfer move (Eqn. 7).

         This follow-up to the original contains the derivations and acceptance rules for the NVT-Gibbs ensemble, the NpT-Gibbs ensemble, and an 
         osmotic pressure Gibbs ensemble.

         Contains detailed discussion about how the NVT-Gibbs ensemble free energy is the same as the Canonical ensemble free energy.  Also analysis
         of why the Gibbs ensemble works better than many people originally expected it to, especially in its ability to predict the a critical point
         that does not suffer much from finite size effects.

         The two-box volume exchange was first described in this paper using a maximum volume displacement.  Towhee uses a maximum change based upon
         the logarithm of the ratio of box volumes.
