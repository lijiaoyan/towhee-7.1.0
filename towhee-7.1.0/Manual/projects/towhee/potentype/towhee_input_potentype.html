		  <li> A hard inner cutoff that can speed computation for Lennard-Jones 
		  systems, and is required to avoid the potential hitting infinity 
		  for exponential repulsion systems which also contain point charges. 
		  This should be set smaller than the smallest radius of any atom. 
		  Generally I set this to 0.5 or 1.0 Angstroms.</li>

		  <li> The inner nonbonded cutoff used in configurational-bias Monte 
		  Carlo moves. This dual-cutoff method can speed configurational-bias 
		  computations by at least a factor of 2, without affecting the acceptance 
		  rate. The inner cutoff is used during the growth procedure, and 
		  the full potential is calculated at the end of the move and everything 
		  is fixed up in the acceptance criteria. I typically set this to 
		  5 Angstroms for noncoulombic simulations, and to 10 Angstroms for 
		  coulombic simulations.</li>

		  already very short ranged so just set this to something larger
