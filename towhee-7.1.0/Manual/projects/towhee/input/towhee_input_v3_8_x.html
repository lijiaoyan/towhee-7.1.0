      <ul>
        This section covers the variables that are set in the towhee_input file 
        Version 3.8.x. Each variable is listed along with its type (logical, character, 
        integer, or double precision). towhee_input is the main input file for 
        Towhee and is generally the only file that needs to be edited on a regular 
        basis. It has a regimented style to the input. The variables are described 
        here in the order they appear in this file. Please look at one of the 
        example files (available with the code package) for the precise file format. 
      </ul>

      <b>Bug reports / feature enhancements for 3.8.x versions</b>
      <ul>
        <li>3.8.9: Made some small changes in the (undocumented) Quest input style.  Fixed up some 
	problems with the distribution (added the towhee_coords files).</li>
        <li>3.8.8: Made a minor change to the format of <b>inpstyle</b> 3 - the nucleic acid builder.  
	Also, added documentation for this feature.</li>
        <li>3.8.7: Fixed a mistake in the EAM implementation that reversed the embedding densities for 
	mixtures.  Added a mixture EAM example to the test suite.</li>
        <li>3.8.6: Added the Charmm27 force field and a nucleic acid builder.</li>
        <li>3.8.5: Added some more torsion types to the TraPPE-UA force field so that it works better for 
	aromatic compounds.</li>
        <li>3.8.4: Added the Embedded Atom Method potential to Towhee along with an example.  Currently I have only 
	verified that this works for single-component systems.</li>
        <li>3.8.3: Fixed a bug in engmolec.F that led to an error in computing the improper torsional energy 
	for the 2-box rotational-bias swap move.</li>
        <li>3.8.2: Fixed a bug in dotproduct.F that caused a crash if one of the vectors passed into that function 
	had a zero length.  This can occur when computing the torsion for a completely linear set of atoms.  Modified 
	the LAMMPS functionallity so it outputs <b>inix</b>, <b>iniy</b>, and <b>iniz</b> values based upon the 
	total number of molecules actually in the system, instead of based upon NMAX.  Made some minor formatting 
	changes in readtowhee.F and writetowhee.F</li>
        <li>3.8.1: The code now computes the average radius of gyration for the molecules in each simulation box</li>
        <li>3.8.0: Replaced the old <b>lnpt</b> variable with the new <b>ensemble</b> variable.</li>
      </ul>

      <b>towhee_input file differences from version 3.7.x</b> 

      <ul>
        <li> Replaced the <b>lnpt</b> variable with <b>ensemble</b>.  The <b>pressure</b> variable is now 
	only listed if the ensemble is 'npt'</li>
      </ul>

      <b>Variable explanations for towhee_input</b> 

      <ul>
        <dt><a name="inputformat"><b>inputformat (character string)</b></a> 
          <ul>
            <li>'Towhee' : reads in the input variables following the format for Towhee.  This is the format 
	    that is described in this file.</li>
	    <li>'LAMMPS' : reads in the input variables from the lammps_input and lammps_data files.  Outputs files 
	    suitable for use with Towhee.</li>
	    <li>'Quest' : reads in the input variables from the quest_input file.  Runs energy calculations for a database 
	    of conformations.  This feature is not documented as it is still under development.</li>
          </ul>

        <dt><a name="ensemble"><b>ensemble (character string of size 3)</b></a> 
          <ul>
            <li> 'npt' if you want the volume moves to be performed in an exchange 
              with an external pressure bath (isobaric isothermal ensemble or 
              isobaric-isothermal Gibbs ensemble).</li>
            <li> 'nvt' if you want the total volume of the system to be conserved. 
              In the case of a multi-box simulation this exchanges volume between 
              pairs of boxes (canonical Gibbs ensemble), in a single box case 
              no volume moves are allowed (canonical ensemble).</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li> The temperature in Kelvin.</li>
          </ul>

        <dt><a name="pressure"><b>pressure (double precision)</b></a> 
          <ul>
            <li> The external pressure in kPa. This in only listed if <b>ensemble</b> is 'npt', otherwise 
	    do not list this variable.</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li> The total number of molecule types in the simulation. This must 
              be less then or equal to NTMAX (see <a href="../code/code_manual.html#preproc">preproc.h</a>).</li>
          </ul>

        <dt><a name="nmolectyp"><b>nmolectyp (integer)</b></a> 
          <ul>
            <li> The number of molecules of each type (listed sequentially on 
             a single line).  This variable was formerly known as <b>moltyp</b>.</li>
          </ul>

        <dt><a name="numboxes"><b>numboxes (integer)</b></a> 
          <ul>
            <li> The number of simulation boxes in the system. This value must 
              be less than or equal to MAXBOXES (set in <a href="../code/code_manual.html#preproc">preproc.h</a>). Note that 
              many of the variables below depend upon numboxes as you will have 
              to provide information for each box (such as box lengths).</li>
          </ul>

        <dt><a name="stepstyle"><b>stepstyle (character string of length 10)</b></a> 
          <ul>
	  The different settings for stepstyle require a different set of variables afterwards.  For each
	  <b>stepstyle</b> I list a description of the resutling step style and the set of variables that must follow.
            <li> 'cycles': Run a Monte Carlo simulation for <b>nstep</b> Monte Carlo cycles.  
	    A cycle is equal to <b>N</b> Monte Carlo moves, where <b>N</b> is the number of molecules in the system.</li>
	      <ul>
	        <dt><a name="stepstyle_cycles_nstep"><b>nstep (integer)</b></a> 
		  <ul>
		    <li> The number of Monte Carlo steps to perform where each step is a cycle.</li>
                  </ul>
                </dt>
	      </ul>

            <li> 'moves': Run a Monte Carlo simulation for <b>nstep</b> Monte Carlo moves.</li>
	      <ul>

		  <ul>
		    <li> The number of Monte Carlo steps to perform where each step is a single move.</li>
                  </ul>
                </dt>
	      </ul>

            <li> 'minimize': Perform a minimization.</li>
	      <ul>
	        <dt><a name="stepstyle_minimize_optstyle"><b>optstyle (integer)</b></a> 
		  <ul>
		    <li> 1: Use the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno variant of the variable-metric
		    or quasi-newton method for minimization.  The suggested reference in Numirical 
		    Recipes was <a href="../references.html#polak_1971">Polak 1971</a>.</li>
                  </ul>
                </dt>
	        <dt><a name="stepstyle_minimize_mintol"><b>mintol (double precision)</b></a> 
		  <ul>
		    <li> The convergance tolerance for the minimization.</li>
                  </ul>
                </dt>
	      </ul>

	    </ul>


        <dt><a name="printfreq"><b>printfreq (integer)</b></a> 
          <ul>
            <li> The step frequency for outputting information about the system to stdout (fort.6). 
	      The information is the number of Monte 
              Carlo steps performed thus far during the run, the total energy 
              in each box, the x-box length of each box, the pressure of each 
              box, and the number of molecules of each type in each box.  This variable was formerly 
	      known as <b>iprint</b></li>
          </ul>

        <dt><a name="blocksize"><b>blocksize (integer)</b></a> 
          <ul>
            <li> The size of the blocks for computing block averages. If you want 
              this to be meaningful then blocksize should divide cleanly into nstep. 
              The quantities that are averaged (in each simulation box) are the 
              specific density, the pressure, all of the energy terms, the chemical 
              potential of each molecule type, number density of each molecule 
              type, and the mole fractions.   This variable was formerly known as <b>iblock</b></li>
          </ul>

        <dt><a name="moviefreq"><b>moviefreq (integer)</b></a></a>
          <ul>
            <li> The step frequency for outputting the system conformations 
              to the towhee_movie file. This file is analyzed after the run using 
              the analyze_movie.F routine to compute a variety of distribution 
              functions. This file can get pretty big if you output frequently 
              so be careful if you have a limited amount of hard disk space available.  This variable was 
	      formerly known as <b>imovie</b></li>
          </ul>

        <dt><a name="backupfreq"><b>backupfreq (integer)</b></a> 
          <ul>
            <li> The step frequency for writing a file named 
              towhee_backup that is suitable for use as a restart file. It overwrites 
              the previous version of towhee_backup each time so it does not take 
              up much space. Typically I set backupfreq so that I get around 10 backups 
              during a run. For more information about restart files look at the 
              manual entries for towhee_initial, towhee_backup, and towhee_final.  This variable was formerly 
	      known as <b>ibackup</b></li>
          </ul>

        <dt><a name="loutpdb"><b>loutpdb (logical)</b></a> 
          <ul>
            <li> .true. if you wish to output Protein Data Bank (pdb) files for 
              each simulation box at the end of the run. These files are named 
              box_xx.pdb where xx is the simulation box number.</li>
            <li> .false. if you do not want to output pdb files.</li>
          </ul>

        <dt><a name="loutdft"><b>loutdft (logical)</b></a> 
          <ul>
            <li> .true. if you wish to output files for use with the Tramonto 
              classical density functional theory code. This outputs dft_surfaces.dat 
              and dft_decode.dat. See the Tramonto code for information on what 
              these files mean.</li>
            <li> .false. if you do not want to output dft files.</li>
          </ul>

        <dt><a name="loutlammps"><b>loutlammps (logical)</b></a> 
          <ul>
            <li> .true. if you wish to output files for use with the LAMMPS massively 
              parallel molecular dynamics code. This outputs lammps_input and 
              lammps_data# where the number is each of the simulation box numbers. 
              See the LAMMPS documentation for more information on how to read 
              in these files.</li>
            <li> .false. if you do not want to output LAMMPS files.</li>
          </ul>

        <dt><a name="pressurefreq"><b>pressurefreq (integer)</b></a> 
          <ul>
            <li> The step frequency for computing the pressure in each simulation box.
	      Be aware that computing the pressure is a fairly expensive 
              task (especially for large systems) so if you don't really care 
              about the computed pressure then it will pay to set <b>pressurefreq</b> to a high 
              value.  This variable formerly known as <b>iratp</b></li>
          </ul>

        <dt><a name="trmaxdispfreq"><b>trmaxdispfreq (integer)</b></a> 
          <ul>
            <li> The step frequency for updating the maximum translational (atom and center-of-mass) and rotational 
              displacements. They are 
              adjusted to try and achieve the target acceptance rates (see <b>tatraa</b>, 
              <b>tatrac</b>, and <b>tarot</b>). It is a good idea to do this fairly frequently 
              at the start of the simulation (every step or every 10 steps) in 
              order to get good values for the maximum displacements. Once the 
              acceptance rates are near their desired values I typically set <b>trmaxdispfreq</b>
              to do 10 updates during a run.  This variable formerly known as <b>iratio</b></li>
          </ul>

        <dt><a name="volmaxdispfreq"><b>volmaxdispfreq (integer)</b></a> 
          <ul>
            <li> The step frequency for updating the maximum volume displacements. 
	      They are adjusted to try and achieve the target acceptance 
              rates (see <b>tavol</b>). It is a good idea to do this fairly frequently 
              at the start of the simulation (every few steps) in order to get 
              good values for the maximum displacements. Once the acceptance rates 
              are near their desired values I typically set <b>volmaxdisp</b> to do 10 updates 
              during a run.  This variable formerly known as <b>iratv</b></li>
          </ul>

        <dt><a name="ffnumber"><b>ffnumber (integer)</b></a> 
          <ul>
	    <li> 1 or more: reads the force field information from this number of file(s) listed in the <b>ff_filename</b>.</li>
          </ul>

        <dt><a name="ff_filename"><b>ff_filename (formatted character*70)</b></a> 
          <ul>
            <li>A list of the filenames (one per line) that contain the force field information.</li>
          </ul>

        <dt><a name="potentyp"><b>potentyp (integer)</b></a> 
          <ul>
	  The different settings for <b>potentyp</b> require a different set of variables afterwards.  For each 
	  <b>potentyp</b> I list a description of the nonbonded potential and the set of variables that must be 
	  specified below the <b>potentyp</b>
            <li> potentyp = 0: 12-6 Lennard-Jones van der Waals potential.</li>

	          <dt>U<sub>nonbond</sub> = 4 * nbcoeff(4) * [ (nbcoeff(3)/r)^12 - (nbcoeff(3)/r)^6 ]</dt>

		  <dt><a name="p0_mixrule"><b>mixrule (integer)</b></a> 
		  <ul>
		    <li> mixrule = 0: Lorentz-Berthelot (arithmetic mean of sigma, geometric 
		    mean of epsilon) mixing rules.</li>
		    <li> mixrule = 1: Geometric (geometric mean of sigma and epsilon) 
		    mixing rules.</li>
		    <li> mixrule = 3: Gromos (geometric mean of sigma and epsilon with 
		    some special cases) mixing rules.</li>
		    <li> mixrule = 4: Explicit (defined in towhee_ff files) mixing rules.</li>
		  </ul>

		  <dt><a name="lshift"><b>lshift (logical)</b></a> 
		  <ul>
		    <li> .true. if you want the nonbonded van der Waals potential to be 
		    shifted so that it is zero at the cutoff.</li>
		    <li> .false. if you do not want to shift the nonbonded van der Waals 
		    potential.</li>
		  </ul>

		  <dt><a name="ltailc"><b>ltailc (logical)</b></a> 
		  <ul>
		    <li>.true. if you want to apply analytical tail corrections for the

		  </ul>

		  <dt><a name="rmin"><b>rmin (double precision)</b></a> 
		  <ul>
		    <li> A hard inner cutoff that can speed computation for Lennard-Jones 
		    systems, and is required to avoid the potential hitting infinity 
		    for exponential repulsion systems which also contain point charges. 
		    This should be set smaller than the smallest radius of any atom. 
		    Generally I set this to 0.5 or 1.0 Angstroms.</li>

		  <dt><a name="rcutin"><b>rcutin (double precision)</b></a> 
		  <ul>
		    <li> The inner nonbonded cutoff used in configurational-bias Monte

		    computations by at least a factor of 2, without affecting the acceptance 
		    rate. The inner cutoff is used during the growth procedure, and 
		    the full potential is calculated at the end of the move and everything 
		    is fixed up in the acceptance criteria. I typically set this to 
		    5 Angstroms for noncoulombic simulations, and to 10 Angstroms for

		  <dt>Historically, the Embedded Atom Method (EAM) uses a lookup table for computing intermolecular 
		  interactions and this precedent is followed in Towhee.  A cubic spline is used to interpolate between the 
		  data points.  EAM is a short-ranged many body potential that captures the many-body effects by computing 
		  a local density about each atom.  This so-called density is actually a distance dependent function.  The 
		  sum of the local density is then fed into the embedding function (also a lookup table) to yeild the 
		  embedding energy.  Additionally, there is a pair potential term using, you guessed it, another lookup table.
		  There is currently no documentation for how to create the proper towhee_ff files for the EAM method, but if 
		  you have an EAM potential that you would like to see implemented into Towhee please contact me and I'll 
		  generate the appropriate files for distribution with the code.</dt>
