      <ul>
        This section covers the variables that are set in the towhee_input
	file Version 4.2.x. Each variable is listed along with its type 
	(logical, character, integer, or double precision). towhee_input 
	is the main input file for Towhee and is generally the only file 
	that needs to be edited on a regular basis. It has a regimented 
	style to the input. The variables are described here in the order 
	they appear in this file. Please look at one of the example files 
	(available with the code package) for the precise file format. 
	<p></p>
	Note that for each variable listed below you must include the name of 
	the variable on the previous line.  In addition, the variables that
	are subsets of various Monte Carlo moves must be indented 10 spaces.
      </ul>

      <b>Bug reports / feature enhancements for 4.2.x versions</b>
      <ul>
        <li>4.2.2: Resolved a bug in the Steele field that was resulting in 
	incorrect energies.  Added the Last1993 force field.</li>
        <li>4.2.1: Added the Steele field, originally for use for simulations 
	of fluids above graphite sheets.  Resolved some problems in writetowhee.F 
	that were resulting in errors of the output to towhee_altinp  for field 
	related variables.</li>
        <li>4.2.0:  Added the outline of a capability to perform simulations 
	using quantum mechanics as the "force field" instead of a classical 
	potential.  This is not yet fully functional and still under active 
	development.  Rebuilt the manner in which external fields are handled 
	and fixed a bug in the 9-3 wall potential that was giving spurious 
	results when using a shifted 9-3 wall field.
      </ul>

      <b>towhee_input file differences from version 4.1.x</b> 

      <ul>
        <li>added the <b>potentialstyle</b> variable and many new variables for 
	use with a quantum potentialstyle</li>
	<li>rebuilt the fields so that a new variable <b>nfield</b> controls the 
	total number of fields and then they are specified using the <b>fieldtype</b>
	variable.</li>
      </ul>

          <ul>
            <li> The number of molecules of each type (listed sequentially on 
             a single line).  For the constant N ensembles (nvt, npt) this is
	     the actual number of molecules in the simulation.  For the constant

              be less than or equal to MAXBOXES (set in 
	      <a href="../code/code_manual.html#preproc">preproc.h</a>). Note that 
              many of the variables below depend upon numboxes as you will have 
              to provide information for each box (such as box lengths) and
	      some Monte Carlo moves are only valid for multiple box ensembles.</li>

          <ul>
	    The different settings for stepstyle require a different set of

	    and the set of variables that must follow.
	    <li> 'cycles': Run a Monte Carlo simulation for <b>nstep</b> Monte Carlo cycles.  
	    A cycle is equal to <b>N</b> Monte Carlo moves, where <b>N</b> is the number of

		  <ul>
		    <li> 1: Use the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno variant of the variable-metric

	</dt>

        <dt><a name="printfreq"><b>printfreq (integer)</b></a> 
          <ul>
            <li> The step frequency for outputting information about the system to stdout (fort.6). 
	      The information is the number of Monte 
              Carlo steps performed thus far during the run, the total energy 
              in each box, the x-box length of each box, the pressure of each 
              box, and the number of molecules of each type in each box.</li>

          <ul>
            <li> The size of the blocks for computing block averages. If you want 
              this to be meaningful then blocksize should divide cleanly into nstep. 
              The quantities that are averaged (in each simulation box) are the 
              specific density, the pressure, all of the energy terms, the chemical 
              potential of each molecule type, number density of each molecule 
              type, and the mole fractions.</li>
          </ul>
	</dt>

        <dt><a name="moviefreq"><b>moviefreq (integer)</b></a></a>
          <ul>
            <li> The step frequency for outputting the system conformations 
              to the towhee_movie file. This file is analyzed after the run using 
              the analyze_movie.F routine to compute a variety of distribution 
              functions. This file can get pretty big if you output frequently 
              so be careful if you have a limited amount of hard disk space available.</li>

            <li> The step frequency for writing a file named 
              towhee_backup that is suitable for use as a restart file. It overwrites 
              the previous version of towhee_backup each time so it does not take 
              up much space. Typically I set backupfreq so that I get around 10 backups 
              during a run. For more information about restart files look at the 
              manual entries for towhee_initial, towhee_backup, and towhee_final.</li>

            <li> .true. if you wish to output Protein Data Bank (pdb) files for 
              each simulation box at the end of the run. These files are named 
              box_xx.pdb where xx is the simulation box number.</li>
            <li> .false. if you do not want to output pdb files.</li>

            <li> .true. if you wish to output files for use with the Tramonto 
              classical density functional theory code. This outputs dft_surfaces.dat 
              and dft_decode.dat. See the Tramonto code for information on what 
              these files mean.</li>
            <li> .false. if you do not want to output dft files.</li>
          </ul>

        <dt><a name="loutlammps"><b>loutlammps (logical)</b></a> 
          <ul>
            <li> .true. if you wish to output files for use with the LAMMPS massively 
              parallel molecular dynamics code. This outputs lammps_input and 
              lammps_data# where the number is each of the simulation box numbers. 
              See the LAMMPS documentation for more information on how to read 
              in these files.</li>
            <li> .false. if you do not want to output LAMMPS files.</li>

        <dt><a name="pressurefreq"><b>pressurefreq (integer)</b></a> 
          <ul>
            <li> The step frequency for computing the pressure in each simulation box.
	      Be aware that computing the pressure is a fairly expensive 
              task (especially for large systems) so if you don't really care 
              about the computed pressure then it will pay to set <b>pressurefreq</b> to a high 
              value.</li>

            <li> The step frequency for updating the maximum translational (atom and center-of-mass) and rotational 
              displacements. They are 
              adjusted to try and achieve the target acceptance rates (see <b>tatraa</b>, 
              <b>tatrac</b>, and <b>tarot</b>). It is a good idea to do this fairly frequently 
              at the start of the simulation (every step or every 10 steps) in 
              order to get good values for the maximum displacements. Once the 
              acceptance rates are near their desired values I typically set <b>trmaxdispfreq</b>
              to do 10 updates during a run.</li>

            <li> The step frequency for updating the maximum volume displacements. 
	      They are adjusted to try and achieve the target acceptance 
              rates (see <b>tavol</b>). It is a good idea to do this fairly frequently 
              at the start of the simulation (every few steps) in order to get 
              good values for the maximum displacements. Once the acceptance rates 
              are near their desired values I typically set <b>volmaxdisp</b> to do 10 updates 
              during a run.</li>
          </ul>
	</dt>

        <dt><a name="chempotperstep"><b>chempotperstep (integer)</b></a> 
          <ul>
            <li> The number of additional trial insertions to perform in each box for 
	    at the end of every Monte Carlo step (listed sequentially for 
	    each molecule type on a single line).  This allows the 
	    measurement of chemical potential in ensembles that do not have an insertion 
	    and deletion move (such as canonical and isobaric-isothermal).</li>
          </ul>
	</dt>

        <dt><a name="potentialstyle"><b>potentialstyle</b></a> 
          <ul>
            <li>'classical': uses a classical intermolecular potential to describe the

	    for potentialstyle, although some quantum options are under active development 
	    and should be available soon.</li>

                <dt><a name="kalp"><b>kalp (double precision)</b></a> 
                  <ul>
		    <li> Value used in the Ewald sum to compute alpha.  If you set <b>kalp</b> and <b>kmax</b> both 
		    to zero then you will effectively disable the Ewald sum.  The actual Ewald sum alpha term is equal to

		  </ul>
		</dt>

		<dt><a name="kmax"><b>kmax (integer)</b></a> 
		  <ul>
		    <li> Maximum number of inverse space vectors to use in any dimension 
		    for the Ewald sum. Recommended value of this parameter is 5. If 
		    you want to set this to a larger value to may have to increase VECTORMAX 
		    (see <a href="../code/code_manual.html#preproc">preproc.h</a>).  Note that you can effectively 
		    disable the Ewald sum by setting both <b>kalp</b> and <b>kmax</b> to zero.</li>
		  </ul>
		</dt>

		<dt><a name="dielect"><b>dielect (double precision)</b></a> 
		  <ul>
		    <li> The dielectric constant used when computing coulombic interactions.  Generally this
		    should be set to 1.0 as the solvated system will act as the screening that the dielectric
		    constant is intended to represent.  If you are performing a simulation without any solvent 
		    (for example a protein without the water) you might want to set the dielectric constant to represent 
		    the missing solvent.</li>
		  </ul>
		</dt>
	      </ul>
	    </li>

              type 2. If you are using initstyle = 2 then this is the only valid 
              option and the other options will be reset to this option by the
              code.</li>
          </ul>
	</dt>

        <li>Note: the pm* variables are used to determine which move type to 
	    perform every time we want to do a Monte Carlo move. A move is selected 
            by choosing a random number between 0.0 and 1.0 and then going down 
            the list of pm* until you find one which has a value higher than the 
            random number.  At least one of the variables must be set to 1.0.
	    A similar procedure is performed when we want to determine which boxes or molecule types 
            to perform the selected move upon. These are done using the pm**pr 
            and pm**mt arrays.
        </li>
	<li>Comment: The formatting of the move variables is now very specific.  In all cases 
	    the first variable for a move (pm***) is left justified (as is the standard for 
	    most variable) while all other variables for that move are indented 10 spaces.
