     <b>Overview</b>
     <ul>
      This section covers the variables that are set in the towhee_input file Version 6.1.x. Each variable is listed along with its type 
      (logical, character, integer, or double precision). towhee_input is the main input file for Towhee and is generally the only file 
      that needs to be edited on a regular basis. It has a regimented style to the input. The variables are described here in the order 
      they appear in this file. Please look at one of the example files (available with the code package) for the precise file format. 
      <p></p>
      Note that for each variable listed below you must include the name of the variable on the previous line.  In addition, the variables that
      are subsets of various Monte Carlo moves must be indented 10 spaces.
      <p></p>
      All Towhee parameter files (including towhee_input) allow internal comments for user convenience.  
      Such comments are lines which begin with the '#' character; the entire line is then ignored. 
      <p></p>
      Some variables are optional.  If the variable name is not included in towhee_input it will be set to the specified default value.
      Optional input file values are marked as <em>optional parameter</em>.

     <b>Bug reports and feature enhancements for 6.1.x versions</b>
     <ul>
      <li>6.1.4: Moved most of the global variables that contain 1-dimensional arrays from globaldata.F to globalinfo.c with the primary benefit of
       now having run-time allocation of memory for those variables.  Removed several #define constants from preproc.h, including all of those related
       to the maximum number of trials during the Configurational-bias moves.  Removed the 'database' option for the 
       <a href="#inputformat"><b>inputformat</b></a> variable.  Made a minor change to the Configurational-bias algorithm to randomly select a valid option
       for trial generation when the number of trials is less than the number of allowed rigid values for trials involving rigid bonds, rigid angles,
       or rigid torsions.  Previously the number of trials was set to the number of allowed rigid values in all cases.  Now that is only done if the 
       specified number of trials is greater than the number of allowed rigid values.
      </li>
      <li>6.1.3: More small changes to improve compilation on a variety of platforms.</li>
      <li>6.1.2: Minor modifications to make Towhee compile cleanly when using the Intel Fortran compilers.  Fixed a significant bug related to the 
       <b>eam_pair_style</b> 'Ackland 3-part' and <b>eam_dens_style</b> 'Ackland cubic sum' that was improperly computing the EAM pair energy and 
       density in the region between the largest value in their Heaviside sum and the value of <b>rcut</b>.  Removed the bubble point ensemble from 
       the manual as this appears to never have been properly implemented.  Perhaps it will return at some point in the future.
      </li>
      <li>6.1.1: Modified the <a href="../examples/example_manual.html#Steele_Wall">Steele Wall</a> example to correct a mistake in the units of one 
       parameter associated with the Steel Wall potential.  Completed an extensive round of updates to the
       <a href="../algorithm/cbmc.html">Configurational-bias Monte Carlo</a> essay in the algorithm section to include detailed descriptions of both of
       the CBMC formulations, and all of the arbitrary trial distributions currently implemented into Towhee.
      </li>
      <li>6.1.0: Added the <a href="#max_bond_length"><b>max_bond_length</b></a> variable that adds an infinite energy term for all bond lengths that are
       larger than this value.  This is required in order for the statistical mechanics to be correct for molecules as the acceptance rules are all written 
       assuming there is only 1 translational degree of freedom per molecule, while the remaining degrees of freedome come from rotational and conformational
       modes.  This value is also used to normalize the bond length distribution and therefore changing this value will change the measured chemical potential
       of any polyatomic molecule.  The default value of this new variable was set to 3.0.
       The <a href="#nfield"><b>nfield</b></a> variable is now optional with a default setting of 0.
       The <a href="#solvation_style"><b>solvation_style</b><a/> variable is now optional with a default setting of 'none'.
       The <a href="#randomseed"><b>randomseed</b></a>, <a href="#random_luxlevel"><b>random_luxlevel</b></a>,
       and <a href="#random_allow_restart"><b>random_allow_restart</b></a> are all now optional variables with default settings used in the case where they
       are not specified.
       Resolved a recently introduced bug that was causing compilation problems in engtotal.F on some platforms.

        <li>.TRUE. (default value) if you want to restart the random number generator from the sequence of integers in towhee_initial if possible.
         This is done when the simulation is restarting from a towhee_initial file generated by Version 5.0.0 or later.  If this

       <ul>
        <li> 'npt' : Isobaric-Isothermal Ensemble.
         The volume moves for each simulation box are performed in an exchange with an external pressure bath set at a specified pressure.  
         The total number of molecules and the temperature are conserved.
         See <a href="../references.html#mcdonald_1972">McDonald 1972</a> for the initial Monte Carlo molecular simulation work using the
         isobaric-isothermal ensemble.  Combining this ensemble with any of the two-box molecule transfer moves turns it into the NPT-Gibbs ensemble.
         See <a href="../references.html#panagiotopoulos_1987">Panagiotopoulos 1987</a>,
         <a href="../references.html#panagiotopoulos_et_al_1988">Panagiotopoulos <i>et al.</i> 1988</a>,

         for the initial Monte Carlo molecular simulation work using the Gibbs ensemble.
        </li>
        <li> 'nvt' : Canonical Ensemble.  The total volume of the system, 
         The total number of each type of molecule in the system, and the temperature are conserved.
         This is the prototypical ensemble for Monte Carlo molecular simulation and was first used in that context by
         <a href="../references.html#metropolis_et_al_1953">Metropolis <i>et al.</i> 1953</a>.
         Combining this ensemble with any of the two-box molecule transfer moves turns it into the NVT-Gibbs ensemble.

         for the initial Monte Carlo molecular simulation work using the Gibbs ensemble.
        </li>
        <li> 'uvt' : Grand Canonical Ensemble.
         The total volume of the system is conserved.  The total number of molecules in the system equilibrates with an external ideal gas bath set at
         a specified chemical potential.

        One line for each simulation box in the system. Each line contains a value for each molecule type.

         where you want to just read positions from a file.
        </li>
        <li>'simple cubic': places the first atom of the molecule onto a simple cubic lattice and the rest of the atoms in the molecule are placed relative to
         that atom.  If you are not using an <b>initstyle</b> of 'coords' then this is probably the option you want to use to generate an initial structure.

      <li>Note: the pm* variables are used to determine which move type to perform every time we want to do a Monte Carlo move. A move is selected 
       by choosing a random number between 0.0 and 1.0 and then going down the list of pm* until you find one which has a value higher than the random number.
       At least one of the variables must be set to 1.0.  A similar procedure is performed when we want to determine which boxes or molecule types 
       to perform the selected move upon. These are done using the pm**pr and pm**mt arrays.

             Once a subvolume is selected then a position in that subvolume is generated uniformly.  This biasing scheme was first used by 
             <a href="../references.html#snurr_et_al_1993">Snurr <i>et al.</i> 1993</a>.  Note that the energy map used in practice is a linear combination

             make sure that the generation probability is strictly positive in all subcubes.  The insertion energies are computed using the initial positions
             of all molecules in simulation box 1.  If you are using this to help with insertions in a porous solid then you may want to only compute this

            <li>'autofit gaussian using max and min 2-4 distance': Additional biasing is utilized during a configurational-bias move step that involves
             the growth of a new atom that is separated from an already existing atom by three bonds where the atoms between those three bonds do not
             currently exist.  The biasing has the following form where i is the atom being grown, h is an atom that already exists and is the atom from
             which i is being grown this step, l is an atom that already exists, and j and k are atoms that have not yet been regrown and bridge 
             the gap between atoms i and l.  The biasing with this option depends upon the minimum (r<sub>jl</sub><sup>min</sup>) and 
             maximum (r<sub>jl</sub><sup>max</sup>) projected distances between the j and l atoms given the constraints that r<sub>ij</sub>
             and &theta<sub>hij</sub> are set to their equilibrium values (r<sub>ij</sub><sup>0</sup> and &theta<sub>hij</sub><sup>0</sup>).
             These extrema are then combined with the 'autofit gaussian' biasing described for the 
             <a href="#two_bond_fixed_endpoint_bias_style"><b>two_bond_fixed_endpoint_bias_style</b></a> option.  The bias probability is set to the

             the gap between atoms i and l.  The biasing is a gaussian that depends only upon the r<sub>il</sub> distance.  This gaussian distribution
             can be set to self-adapt during the course of the simulation so that the biasing probability reflects the observed probability for the
             r<sub>il</sub> distances.  When using this option you also need to include the following variables.
