      <ul>
        This section covers the variables that are set in the towhee_input
	file Version 4.11.x. Each variable is listed along with its type 
	(logical, character, integer, or double precision). towhee_input 
	is the main input file for Towhee and is generally the only file 
	that needs to be edited on a regular basis. It has a regimented 
	style to the input. The variables are described here in the order 
	they appear in this file. Please look at one of the example files 
	(available with the code package) for the precise file format. 
	<p></p>
	Note that for each variable listed below you must include the name of 
	the variable on the previous line.  In addition, the variables that
	are subsets of various Monte Carlo moves must be indented 10 spaces.
      </ul>

      <b>Bug reports and feature enhancements for 4.11.x versions</b>
      <ul>
        <li>4.11.7: More small fixes for problems with the determination of the autofit gaussian parameters.</li>
        <li>4.11.6: Fixed a problem in the angle energy computation that was giving not a number when the 
	  angle was zero degrees with the Charmm angle.  Modified the volume moves so the average change 
	  in energy per change in volume is only computed for isotropic volume change moves.  This term
	  is used to compute Hummer's thermodynamic pressure.
	</li>
        <li>4.11.5: Rebuilt some of the internal routines for handling the towhee_input file input and 
	  output.  This resulted in some small format changes in the output.  Fixed a bug in the dihedral 
	  generation routines that was using biased distributions to generate some dihedrals that should 
	  have been uniform instead.  Fixed some other problems related to the generation of dihedral trials 
	  using arbitrary distributions.  Added the 
	  <a href="../forcefields/alavi2005.html">Alavi <i>et al.</i> 2005</a> force field.
	</li>
        <li>4.11.4: Fixed bugs related to the use of Gaussian distributions to generate bond, angle, or 
	  torsion trials when using some of the newer <b>cbmc_x_generation</b> options.  These distributions 
	  were not being normallized properly and this affected the Rosenbluth weights, and therefore the 
	  chemical potential.  Replaced the 'ideal' <b>cbmc_bond_generation</b> style with the more 
	  appropriately named 'r^2 with bounds' as that is a better description of the generation style.
	  Fixed a bug related to the normalization of the 'r^2 with bounds' bond generation and the true
	  distribution is now just proporational to r<sup>2</sup> with no normalization constant as it is not 
	  clear what to use for a distribution of infinte extent.  All <b>cbmc_bond_generation</b> styles 
	  now give the same chemical potential for the bond interaction, which was not true previously.
	</li>
        <li>4.11.3: Fixed some bugs related to the 'helix cbmc' initialization option and added a new 
	  example using this functionality 
	  (<a href="../examples/example_manual.html#Charmm27_Polyalanine">Charmm27_Polyalanine</a>).
	</li>
        <li>4.11.2: Improved the manual pages describing the configurational-bias Monte Carlo moves 
	  as implemented into Towhee.  Minor changes to other web manual pages.
	</li>
        <li>4.11.1: Added a new <a href="../examples/example_manual.html#Formamide_Scaled">example</a>
          that exercises the new 'Scaled Lennard-Jones' classical potential.
        </li>
	<li>4.11.0: Created a new version of the <a href="../towhee_ff.html">towhee_ff</a> 
	  format (version 10) in order to handle some bug fixes to the bending potentials used 
	  in the <a href="../forcefields/uff.html">UFF</a> force field and made some related 
	  changes to some of the angle terms in that forcefield.  Added the 'Scaled Lennard-Jones'
	  classical potential and some new variables that are required for that potential.
	</li>
      </ul>

      <b>towhee_input file differences from version 4.10.x</b> 
      <ul>

              be less than or equal to MAXBOXES (set in

        <dt><a name="stepstyle"><b>stepstyle (character string of length 10)</b></a> 
          <ul>
	    <li> 'cycles': Run a Monte Carlo simulation for <b>nstep</b> Monte Carlo cycles.

          <ul>
            <li> The size of the blocks for computing block averages. If you want 
              this to be meaningful then blocksize should divide cleanly into nstep. 
              The quantities that are averaged (in each simulation box) are the 
              specific density, the pressure, all of the energy terms, the chemical 
              potential of each molecule type, number density of each molecule

          <ul>
            <li> The step frequency for outputting the system conformations 
              to the towhee_movie file. This file is analyzed after the run using 
              the analyze_movie.F routine to compute a variety of distribution 
              functions. This file can get pretty big if you output frequently

              towhee_backup that is suitable for use as a restart file. It overwrites 
              the previous version of towhee_backup each time so it does not take 
              up much space. Typically I set backupfreq so that I get around 10 backups 
              during a run. For more information about restart files look at the 
              manual entries for towhee_initial, towhee_backup, and towhee_final.</li>

	      box_xx_step_yyyyyyyyyyyyyy.pdb where xx is the box number converted into a 2 character 
	      string and yyyyyyyyyyyyyy is the step number converted into a 14 character string.

        <dt><a name="pressurefreq"><b>pressurefreq (integer)</b></a> 
          <ul>
            <li> The step frequency for computing the pressure via the pressure virial (for continuous 
	      potentials) or the radial pressure (for discontinuous potentials) in each simulation box.
	      Be aware that computing the pressure is a relatively expensive task (especially for large systems).
	      If you do not wish to compute the pressure using these methods you can set the <b>pressurefreq</b>

            <li> The step frequency for updating the maximum translational (atom and center-of-mass) and rotational 
              displacements. They are 
              adjusted to try and achieve the target acceptance rates (see <b>tatraa</b>, 
              <b>tatrac</b>, and <b>tarot</b>). It is a good idea to do this fairly frequently 
              at the start of the simulation (every step or every 10 steps) in 
              order to get good values for the maximum displacements. Once the

		      <ul>
			<dt><a name="sdevvib"><b>sdevvib (double precision)</b></a> 
			  <ul>
			    The standard deviation of a gaussian distribution that is used to 
			    sample bond lengths during a <a href="../algorithm/cbmc.html">configurational-bias</a> 
			    regrowth for a <b>cbmc_bond_generation</b> style of 'global gaussian'.  Units are Angtroms.  
			    For best results perform a short simulation of single-atom translation moves, analyse that 
			    data using the <a href="../utils/analyse_movie.html">analyse_movie</a> utility, and set 
			    this value to the observed standard deviations in the bond length distribution.
			  </ul>
			</dt>
		      </ul>
		    </li>
		    <li>'autofit gaussian': Generate trial bond lengths according to a gaussian distribution with a mean 
		      and standard deviation fitted to r<sup>2</sup> exp<sup>(-beta U<sub>bond</sub>)</sup>.  When using this option 
		      you also need to include the following variable.
		      <ul>
		        <dt><a name="bond_sdev_multiplier"><b>bond_sdev_multiplier (double precision)</b></a>
			  <ul>
			    This value is multiplied by the observed standard deviation of the 
			    r<sup>2</sup> exp<sup>(-beta U<sub>bond</sub>)</sup> distribution in order to determine the 
			    standard deviation used to generate bond trials.  This value must be positive.
			    The currently suggested value is 1.0.

		<dt><a name="nch_vib"><b>nch_vib (integer) [one value for each molecule type]</b></a> 
		  <ul>
		    <li> The number of trial bond lengths that are sampled during a
		      <a href="../algorithm/cbmc.html">configurational-bias</a> move. 
		      This value must be positive.  Currently suggested values are 1000 trials 
		      for <b>cbmc_bond_generation</b> style 'r^2 with bounds' and a value in the range 
		      of 1 to 10 for <b>cbmc_bond_generation</b> styles 'global gaussian' and
