     <dt><b>Overview</b> 
      <ul>
       This section explains the analyse_histogram utility program.  This program is designed for use in conjunction with the towhee_histogram files and is
       used to analyze the histogram data generated by the grand canonical ensemble.
      </ul>
     </dt>

     <dt><b>Compiling</b> 
      <ul>
       analyse_histogram.F is a stand alone utility program that may be compiled using the Utility Makefile
       <ul>
        <dt>cd /towheebase/Utils</dt>
        <dt>make analyse_histogram
       </ul>
       This will create the analyse_histogram executable which can then be run from the command line.  In order to successfully run analyse_histogram,
       two sources of input are required.  The first is an input file named 'input_analyse_histogram', which contains parameters that define what analysis
       you would like to perform.  These parameters will be defined in the following section.  The second input is the histogram files which are generated
       by performing simulations of the grand canonical ensemble in towhee (towhee_histogram).
      </ul>
     </dt>

     <dt><b>Features</b> 
      <ul>
       Run the analyse_histogram utility routine by calling the routine from a directory that contains towhee_histogram output files from a MCCCS Towhee
       simulation run and a copy of the input_analyse_histogram which is setup so that your desired calculations will be performed.  Below is a list of
       the calculations that analyse_histogram can perform and the representative file names that will contain the results.  
       <ul>
        <li>histogram reweighting (lweight is .true.): this computes the weights for the histograms using the 
         method of <a href="../references.html#ferrenberg_swendsen_1989">Ferrenberg and Swendsen 1989</a>
         The weights are output into a file called towhee_weights, which can be used as input in the lold option.  
         Also, converge.dat, which contains the number of iterations and the deviation, is outputted during these 
         calculations so that you can see how well the algorithm is converging. 
        </li>
        <li>phase coexistence calculations (lphase is .true.): this computes the phase coexistence for binary 
         mixtures using Newton's method.  The phase coexistence data is output in 'phase_coex.dat.'  The distribution 
         of the number of each component <i>n</i> at each temperature <i>t</i> is output in a file called 
         'phasecomp<i>n</i>temp<i>t</i>.dat.' 
        </li>
        <li>pvt calculations (lpvt is .true.): calculates ln <i>Z</i> vs. <i>n</i> (number of molecules) data so 
         that the constant in 'pv/T = ln xi + constant' may be found. The ln<i>Z</i> and <i>n</i> data is 
         output in a file called 'pvt.dat'.  Also, the distribution of each component <i>n</i> at each temperature 
         <i>t</i> is output in a file called 'pvtcomp<i>n</i>temp<i>t</i>.dat.' 
        </li>
       </ul>
      </ul>
     </dt>
