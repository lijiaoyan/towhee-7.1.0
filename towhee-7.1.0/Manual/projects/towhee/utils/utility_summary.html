     <b>Overview</b> 
     <ul>
      This section summarizes the utility programs that are included with the Towhee code distribution (generally in the <b>Utils</b> directory).
      It also contains links to detailed information explaining how to use each of these programs.
     </ul>
     <b>Post-Processing Data Analysis Utilities</b> 
     <ul>
      <b><a href="analyse_histogram.html">analyse_histogram</a></b> 
      <ul>
       This program is designed for use in conjunction with the <b>towhee_histogram</b> files and is used to analyze the histogram data generated by
       the grand canonical ensemble.
      </ul>

      <b><a href="analyse_movie.html">analyse_movie</a></b> 
      <ul>
       This program is designed for use in conjunction with the Towhee MCCCS file and is used to compute quantities from the <b>towhee_movie</b> file.
      </ul>

      <b><a href="fitcoex.html">fitcoex</a></b> 
      <ul>
       This program replaces the old fitvlcc utility and is designed for use in conjunction with the <b>towhee_vlcc</b> output files in order to compute 
       the critical temperature and critical density from a sequence of single-component vapour-liquid simulations.
      </ul>

      <b><a href="parse_vlcc_plots.html">parse_vlcc_plots</a></b> 
      <ul>
       This script is designed for use in conjunction with the standard towhee output file used in a single-component vapour-liquid simulation and
       it extracts the snapshot and block average information from that file in order to create a series of plottable files.
      </ul>
     </ul>

     <b>Pre-Processing File Conversion Utilities</b> 
     <ul>
      <b><a href="charmm2pdb.html">charmm2pdb</a></b> 
      <ul>
       This program is designed to translate the polypeptide pdb files generated by Charmm into the standard pdb format to allow further processing via
       the pdb2towhee routine.
      </ul>

      <b><a href="faux2towhee.html">faux2towhee</a></b> 
      <ul>
       This program is designed to translate some zeolite coordinate files that were kindly provided to me by David Faux into a format suitable for Towhee.
       This utility is unlikely to be of use to anyone else, but may serve as an example for other one-time file translations.
      </ul>

      <b><a href="forcefield.html">forcefield</a></b> 
      <ul>
       This program uses many of the main Towhee subroutines along with several additional subroutines to convert a forcefield from a different format
       into the 
       <a href="../towhee_ff.html">Towhee Force Field Format</a>.  It is capable of generating almost all of the force field files included in the
       ForceFields directory of the Towhee distribution.
      </ul>

      <b><a href="pdb2towhee.html">pdb2towhee</a></b> 
      <ul>
       This program is designed to translate the standard pdb files into appropriate Towhee files for starting a simulation.  In all cases it will output
       a <b>towhee_coords</b> file full of the system coordinates.  In certain cases it will output a <b>towhee_altinp</b> file with partial information
       required to set up a polypeptide molecule template.
      </ul>

      <b><a href="rdf2pmfpair.html">rdf2pmfpair</a></b> 
      <ul>
       This program converts a radial distribution function into a potential of mean force.  The potential of mean force file is then suitable for
       conversion into a tabulated pair potential using the forcefield program.
      </ul>

      <b><a href="unitcell.html">unitcell</a></b> 
      <ul>
       This program is used to take a towhee_coords file and duplicate it any number of times in the x, y, and z dimensions in order to perform a
       larger simulation.  
      </ul>

      <b><a href="xmd2towhee.html">xmd2towhee</a></b> 
      <ul>
       This program converts EAM force field files that are in the <a href="http://www.ims.uconn.edu/centers/simul/pot/potformat.htm">XMD format</a>
       into a format suitable for use in Towhee.
      </ul>

      <b><a href="xyz2towhee.html">xyz2towhee</a></b> 
      <ul>
       This program converts simple xyz format files into a series of files that can be used to construct a <b>towhee_coords</b> file for Towhee.
      </ul>
     </ul>
