      <ul>
        This section covers the Ackland <i>et al.</i> 2004 iron and phosphorus parameters as they are implemented into the 
	towhee_ff_Ackl2004 file in the ForceFields directory.  All of the Towhee atom types for this force field 
	are listed, along with a short description of their meanings.  This force field was intended for solid and liquid
	simulation of iron with small amounts of phosphorus impurities, uses the 'Embedded Atom Method' potential,
	and is not easily combined with other potentials due to the explicit mixing rules used with that potential.
        I would like to acknowledge Graeme Ackland who provides an electronic copy of these parameters on his 
	<a href="http://homepages.ed.ac.uk/graeme/">web page</a>.
	Any discrepencies (especially typos) from the published values 
	are the sole responsibility of Marcus G. Martin, and I welcome feedback on how this implementation compares
	with other programs.

      <b>Ackland <i>et al.</i> 2004 in Towhee</b> 
      <ul>
        The official force field name for these parameters is 'Ackl2004'.  Here I list the 
	atom names for use in the towhee_input file, along with a brief description (although 
	the meaning of the atom names should be obvious).  There were two parameterizations presented 
	in that paper and they are both implemented here.

	Please note that the capitalization and spacing pattern is important 
	and must be followed exactly as listed here.
	<ul>
          <li><b>'Fe'</b> : iron.  Uses a 5.3 Angstrom cutoff.</li>
          <li><b>'P'</b> : phosphorus.  Uses a 5.3 Angstrom cutoff.</li>
	</ul>
      </ul>

      <b>Coulombic interactions</b> 
      <ul>
        There are no coulombic interactions for this potential.
      </ul>
