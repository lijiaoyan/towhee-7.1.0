      <ul>
        This section covers the Shah and Maginn 2004 (Shah2004) force field as it is implemented into 
	the towhee_ff_Shah2004 file in the ForceFields directory.  This force field was
	designed for an ionic liquid of 1-<i>n</i>-butyl-3-methylimidazolium [bmim] hexafluorophosphate [PF<sub>6</sub>].
	Note that this is a Lennard-Jones force field that uses the 'Lorentz-Berthelot' mixing rules.
	Any discrepencies (especially typos) from the published values are the sole responsibility
	of Marcus G. Martin, and I welcome feedback on how this implementation compares
	with other programs.
      </ul>

      <b>References for Shah and Maginn 2004</b> 
      <ul>
        This forcefield is described in a single paper.

      <b>Typos and comments for Shah and Maginn 2004</b>
      <ul>
	<li>Full Lennard-Jones interactions are used for 1-4 interactions, while the Coulombic 1-4 terms are scaled by 1/2 
	  [personal communication between E.J. Maginn and M.G. Martin 04-21-2006].  This is with the execption of the ring 
	  dihedrals that are held rigid and so there is no reason to compute the 1-4 terms.
	</li>
	<li>Note that the coordinates presented for the PF<sub>6</sub> structure result in asymmetric bond lengths and bending 
	  angles.  I have  inlcluded that as an atom-specific implementation of PF<sub>6</sub>, and I have also included an 
	  option for symmetric PF<sub>6</sub> using the bond length from 
	  <a href="../references.html#morrow_maginn_2002">Morrow and Maginn 2002</a>.
	</li>
	<li>Note that all of the rigid interactions in this molecule means you need to start the simulation using a template for
	  both molecules.  Coordinates suitable for a template are found in Table 1 of
	  <a href="../references.html#shah_maginn_2004">Shah and Maginn 2004</a>.

      <b>Shah and Maginn 2004 in Towhee</b> 
      <ul>
        The official force field name for Shah and Maginn 2004 in Towhee is 'Shah2004'.  Here is the list
	of atom names for use in the towhee_input file, along with a brief description.  These names correspond to those 
	used in <a href="../references.html#shah_maginn_2004">Shah and Maginn 2004</a>.  I have also included an option 
	for a symmetric PF<sub>6</sub> using a perfect octahedral geometry and a P-F bond length taken from 
	<a href="../references.html#morrow_maginn_2002">Morrow and Maginn 2002</a>.
	Please note that the capitalization and spacing pattern is important 
	and must be followed exactly as listed here.

      <b>Coulombic interactions</b> 
      <ul>
        This force field uses point charges and has been set up to assign the point charges using the bond increment method.
	The charges for bmim are assigned according to Table 2 of 
	<a href="../references.html#shah_maginn_2004">Shah and Maginn 2004</a>.
