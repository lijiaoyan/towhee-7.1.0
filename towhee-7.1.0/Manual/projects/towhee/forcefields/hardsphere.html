    <td width="697" valign="top"> <b>Overview</b> 
      <ul>
        This section covers Hard Sphere parameters as they are implemented into the towhee_ff_HardSphere file in the ForceFields 
	directory.  It is a bit strong
	to call this a force field, as all there is to the hard spheres is a series of sigma values, but this explains
	how to use the builder with the hard sphere potentials, and how to add in any other hard sphere diameters that 
	you might want to use in a simulation.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </ul>


      <b>Hard Spheres in Towhee</b> 


      <ul>
        The official force field name for Hard Spheres in Towhee is 'HardSphere'.  Here I list all of 
	the Hard Sphere atom names currently in use for the towhee_input file, along with a brief description (although 
	the meaning of the atom names should be obvious).  If you want to add any new hard sphere diameters into Towhee
	just take a look in the ffhardsphere.F subroutine.  Search for 
	one of the atom types listed below and you will find the complete listing of hard sphere parameters.  It 
	should be obivous how to add new atom diameters from the examples.
	Please note that the capitalization and spacing pattern is important 
	and must be followed exactly as listed here.
	<ul>
          <li><b>'hs0.0'</b> : hard sphere with 0.0 diameter.  This is essentially an ideal atom, but it is still 
	  excluded from being inside of other atoms.  Thus it is a hard point potential.</li>
          <li><b>'hs0.5'</b> : hard sphere with 0.5 diameter.</li>
          <li><b>'hs1.0'</b> : hard sphere with 1.0 diameter.</li>
	</ul>
      </ul>

      <b>Coulombic interactions</b> 
      <ul>
        It is possible to combine the hard sphere potential with point charges.  Simply assign the point charges to the 
	atoms as you see fit.
      </ul>

      <b>Improper torsions</b> 
      <ul>
        There are no improper torsions set up specifically for hard spheres.
      </ul>

      <b>Proteins</b> 
      <ul>
        There are no features to build proteins out of hard spheres.
      </ul>
