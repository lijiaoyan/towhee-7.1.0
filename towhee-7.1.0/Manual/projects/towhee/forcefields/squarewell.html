    <td width="697" valign="top"> <b>Overview</b> 
      <ul>
        This section covers Square Well parameters as they are implemented into the towhee_ff_SquareWell file in the ForceFields 
	directory.  It is a bit strong
	to call this a force field, as all there is not much to a square well
	potential, but this file explains
	how to use the builder with the square well potential, and how to add
	in any other square well parameters that 
	you might want to use in a simulation.
      </ul>

      <b>Square Well in Towhee</b> 

      <ul>
        The official force field name for Square Well in Towhee is 'SquareWell'.  Here I list all of 
	the Square Well atom names currently in use for the towhee_input file,
	along with a brief description (although the meaning of the atom names should be obvious).  
	If you want to add any new parameters into Towhee just take a look in the 
	<a href="../potentype/towhee_input_classical_potential.html">towhee_input 
	classical_potential</a> documentation
	for a complete description of the functional form.  I am happy to add
	some more of these parameter sets into the release version as well
	(only takes a few minutes).  The distance units are in Angstroms, and
	the well depth is in Kelvin divided by Boltzmann's constant.
	Please note that the capitalization and spacing pattern is important 
	and must be followed exactly as listed here.
	<ul>
          <li><b>'type_a'</b> : sigma [nbcoeff(1)] is 1.0, lamda [nbcoeff(2)]
	    is 1.5, and the well depth [nbcoeff(3)] is 1.0.</li>
          <li><b>'type_b'</b> : sigma [nbcoeff(1)] is 2.0, lamda [nbcoeff(2)]
	    is 3.0, and the well depth [nbcoeff(3)] is 1.0.</li>
	</ul>
      </ul>

      <b>Coulombic interactions</b> 
      <ul>
        It is possible to combine the square well potential with point charges.  Simply assign the point charges to the 
	atoms as you see fit.
      </ul>
