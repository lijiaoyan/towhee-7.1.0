      <ul>
        This section covers the Alavi <i>et al.</i> 2005 (Alavi2005) force field as it is implemented into 
	the towhee_ff_Alavi2005 file in the ForceFields directory.  All of the Towhee atom types for 
	this force field are listed, along with a short description of their meanings.
	Note that this a Lennard-Jones (12-6) force field and can only be combined with
	other Lennard-Jones (12-6) force fields.
	Any discrepencies (especially typos) from the published values are the sole responsibility of 
	Marcus G. Martin, and I welcome feedback on how this implementation compares with other programs.
      </ul>
      <b>References for Alavi2005</b> 
      <ul>
        This force field was published in a single paper where it was used along with the 
	<a href="spce.html">SPC/E</a> force field for water.

      <b>Alavi <i>et al.</i> 2005 in Towhee</b> 
      <ul>
        The official force field name for Alavi <i>et al.</i> 2005 in Towhee is 'Alavi2005'.  Here I list all of 
	the atom names for use in the towhee_input file, along with a brief description.  I created these
	atom names in order to work with the molecule assembler.  This force field was designed to work with the 
	<a href="spce.html">SPC/E</a> water model.  This force field uses a three site model for H<sub>2</sub> 
	as described below.
	Please note that the capitalization and spacing pattern is important 
	and must be followed exactly as listed here.
	<ul>
          <li><b>'H2-com'</b> : the center of mass of an H<sub>2</sub> molecule.  This atom type has no mass itself 
	    and should be bonded to 2 <b>H2-end</b> sites.
	  </li>
          <li><b>'H2-end'</b> : hydrogen atom in H<sub>2</sub>.  This atom type represents the mass point for 
	    each hydrogen atom and should be bonded to the <b>H2-com</b> site.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </ul>
      <b>Coulombic interactions</b> 
      <ul>
        Alavi2005 assigns a point charge to the H<sub>2</sub> mass sites and also to the center of mass location.
	The bond increment method is implemented for this forcefield and can be used to automatically assign 
	appropriate charges.
	Please see the <a href="../inpstyle/inpstyle_2.html">inpstyle 2</a> documentation for 
	further information on enabling this option.
	Here I list the bond increments using the bond names listed above.  The value of the bond increment is added 
	to the first atom listed and subtracted from the second atom listed.
	<ul>
	  <li><font color="green">H2-end</font> - <font color="green">H2-com</font>: 0.4932</li>
	</ul>
      </ul>
