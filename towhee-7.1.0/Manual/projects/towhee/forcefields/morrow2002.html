      <ul>
        This section covers the Morrow and Maginn 2002 (Morrow2002) force field as it is implemented into 
	the towhee_ff_Morrow2002 file in the ForceFields directory.  This force field was
	designed for an ionic liquid of 1-<i>n</i>-butyl-3-methylimidazolium [bmim] hexafluorophosphate [PF<sub>6</sub>].
	Note that this is a Lennard-Jones force field that uses the 'Lorentz-Berthelot' mixing rules.
	Any discrepencies (especially typos) from the published values are the sole responsibility
	of Marcus G. Martin, and I welcome feedback on how this implementation compares
	with other programs.
      </ul>

      <b>References for Morrow and Maginn 2002</b> 
      <ul>
        This forcefield is described in a single paper and an erratum.

      <b>Typos and comments for Morrow and Maginn 2002</b>
      <ul>
        <li>The parameters implemented for this force field are from the erratum.</li>
	<li>All bonds involving hydrogen were held rigid in their work using SHAKE, and are therefore implemented here as rigid bonds.</li>
	<li>Full Lennard-Jones interactions are used for 1-4 interactions, while the Coulombic 1-4 terms are scaled by 1/2 
	  [personal communication between E.J. Maginn and M.G. Martin 04-21-2006].
	</li>
	<li>The second to last angle term in Table 2 of the erratum should read N-C<sub>7</sub>-H<sub>7,8</sub> instead of 
	  N-C<sub>7</sub>-H<sub>8,9</sub> [personal communication between E.J. Maginn and M.G. Martin 04-21-2006].
	</li>
	<li>No value for the H-C8-C9-H dihedral was specified in their papers.  It has been implemented here using the published 
	  H-C7-C8-H term.
	</li>
	<li>The authors claim that the charge on PF<sub>6</sub> adds up to -0.904, and the charge on bmim adds up to 0.904.  However, 
	  the partial charges they list for PF<sub>6</sub> using assymmetric charge assignments adds up to -0.903, which does not properly 
	  balance the charge of the bmin.  I have adjusted this by utlizing the stated charges on the Fluorines, and placing the remainder of 
	  the charge on the Phosphorous.

        The official force field name for Morrow and Maginn 2002 in Towhee is 'Morrow2002'.  Here is the list
	of atom names for use in the towhee_input file, along with a brief description.  These names correspond to those 
	used in <a href="../references.html#morrow_maginn_2002">Morrow and Maginn 2002</a>.
	Please note that the capitalization and spacing pattern is important 
	and must be followed exactly as listed here.

      <b>Coulombic interactions</b> 
      <ul>
        This force field uses point charges and has been set up to assign the point charges using the bond increment method.
	The charges for bmim are assigned according to Table 1 of 
	<a href="../references.html#morrow_maginn_2002">Morrow and Maginn 2002</a>.
	There are two possible charge distributions for hexafluorophosphate.  If you specify each of the Fluorine atoms (F1, ..., F6) 
	then the charges are assigned according to Table 1 of
	<a href="../references.html#morrow_maginn_2002">Morrow and Maginn 2002</a>, with the exception that the P charge is 1.457 instead 
	of the stated 1.478 (see the notes above).  If you specify a generic Fluorine atom (F), then
	the charge on the Phosphorous is the same as in Table 1, while the Fluorines are assigned symmetric charges in order to achieve 
	a total molecule charge of -0.904.
