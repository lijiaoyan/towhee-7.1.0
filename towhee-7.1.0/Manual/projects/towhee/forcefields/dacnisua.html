      <ul>
        This section covers the DACNIS United Atom force field as it is implemented into 
	the towhee_ff_DACNIS-UA file in the ForceFields directory.  All of the Towhee atom types for the DACNIS United Atom force 
	field are listed, along with a short description of their meanings.  DACNIS-UA is a 
	little force field I created for performing some simulations of methane and ethane 
	adsorption in silicalite using a cut-and-shift potential.  This was useful as the 
	main application of the force field was computing the transport of methane through
	silicalite using the dual control volume grand canoical molecular dynamics code Ladera.
	Note that DACNIS United Atom is a Lennard-Jones (12-6) force field and can only be combined with
	other Lennard-Jones (12-6) force fields.
	I welcome feedback on how this implementation compares with other programs (assuming anyone else 
	has ever bothered to implement this force field).

      <b>DACNIS-UA in Towhee</b> 
      <ul>
        The official force field name for DACNIS United Atom in Towhee is 'DACNIS-UA'.  Here I list all of 
	the DACNIS atom names for use in the towhee_input file, along with a brief description.  I created these
	atom names in order to work with the molecule assembler.  DACNIS-UA is a united atom force field which lumps 
	atoms together.  There are only three different groups at the moment.  Note that the Ozeo group is designed 
	for a fixed conformation of silicalite so it has no bonded interactions.
	
	Please note that the capitalization and spacing pattern is important 
	and must be followed exactly as listed here.
	<ul>
          <li><b>'CH4sp3'</b> : methane</li>
          <li><b>'CH3sp3'</b> : sp<sup>3</sup> non-aromatic carbon bonded to three hydrogens and one heavy atom</li>
          <li><b>'Ozeo'</b> : oxygen groups in silicalite.</li>
	</ul>
      </ul>
      <b>Coulombic interactions</b> 
      <ul>
        There are currently no coulombic interactions in the DACNIS-UA force field.
      </ul>
      <b>Improper torsions</b> 
      <ul>
        DACNIS-UA does not utilize improper torsions.
      </ul>

      <b>Proteins</b> 
      <ul>
        DACNIS-UA does not have all of the groups needed for protein simulations.
