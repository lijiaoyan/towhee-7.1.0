      <ul>
        This section covers the QMFF-VIII force field as it is implemented into 
	the towhee_ff_QMFF-VIII file in the ForceFields directory.  This force field was
	designed for a variety of organic liquids.
	Note that this is a Class-2 9-6 force field that uses the 'Sixth Power' mixing rules.
	Any discrepencies (especially typos) from the published values are the sole responsibility
	of Marcus G. Martin, and I welcome feedback on how this implementation compares
	with other programs.
      </ul>

      <b>References for QMFF-VIII</b> 
      <ul>
        This forcefield is described in a single paper, and the supplementary information for that paper.
	<ul>

	</ul>
      </ul>	

      <b>Typos and comments for QMFF-VIII</b>
      <ul>
        <li>The supplementary information contains a few additional parameters that were not mentioned in the main paper.
	  These have been implemented, although I am not positive about how they were intended to be used.
	</li>
	<li>The supplementary information does not contain the c= h* and n= parameters.  I believe that a formatting error 
	  has replaced those symbols with additional c h and n parameters because there are duplicates of those listed there.
	  I have been unable to get a useful response from any of the authors and therefore have used some logic combined 
	  with inspiration in order to attempt to reproduce the true values from the duplicates.  Here I list all of the 
	  changes I made to the supplementary information in order to create the values implemented into Towhee.
	  <ul>
	    <li>The <b>h</b> and <b>h*</b> atom types are distinct, but given that they are mixed together due to a 
	      formatting error in the file, and that they are bonded to different atom types, all of their bonded terms 
	      are treated as a generic <b>h</b>.  This will work properly so long as the <b>h</b> atom types are only 
	      bonded to carbon and sulfur while the <b>h*</b> atom types are only bonded to oxygen and nitrogen.
	    </li>
	    <li>The <b>c=</b> term was erroneously listed as an additional <b>c</b> term in the supplementary information.
	      Any time a duplicate term is listed that includes a <b>c</b> I assume that this was actually supposed to 
	      be a <b>c=</b>.  Given that most of the terms are listed in order in that file it is relatively easy to 
	      figure out which terms should be <b>c=</b>.
	    </li>
	    <li>The <b>n=</b> term was erroneously listed as an additional <b>n</b> term in the supplementary information.
	      Any time a duplicate term is listed that includes a <b>n</b> I assume that this was actually supposed to 
	      be a <b>n=</b>.  Given that most of the terms are listed in order in that file it is relatively easy to 
	      figure out which terms should be <b>n=</b>.
	    </li>
	    <li>An additional oxygen term is listed and I do not know the purpose for which it was originally intended.
	      I have labeled the second of any duplicate oxygens as <b>o?</b>.
	    </li>
	    <li>Page 50 Line 29: assumed that the duplicate van der Waals listing for <b>c</b> was intended for <b>c=</b></li>
	    <li>Page 50 Line 38: assumed that the duplicate van der Waals listing for <b>h</b> was intended for <b>h*</b></li>
	    <li>Page 50 Line 44: assumed that the duplicate van der Waals listing for <b>n</b> was intedned for <b>n=</b></li>
	    <li>Page 51 Line 5: a duplicate van der Waals listing for <b>o</b> is on this line is a mystery and was set 
	      to the mystery oxygen <b>o?</b>
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
      </ul>

      <b>QMFF-VIII in Towhee</b> 
      <ul>
        The official force field name for QMFF-VIII in Towhee is 'Shah2004'.  Here is the list
	of atom names for use in the towhee_input file, along with a brief description.  These names are from the 
	main text of the paper, and also include atoms from the supplementary information that do not have a 
	description of their proper use.
	Please note that the capitalization and spacing pattern is important 
	and must be followed exactly as listed here.
	<ul>
	  <dt><font color="red">Bromine</font></dt>
          <li><b>Br</b> : no explanation provided.  This was assigned a mass appropriate for bromine and 
	    I suspect it is intended for Br<sup>-</sup> ion.</li>
          <li><b>br</b> : no explanation provided.  This was assigned a mass appropriate for bromine and 
	    I suspect it is intended for a bonded bromine, but while bond increment parameters are included, 
	    there are no bond vibration parameters so it is not usable as currently implemented.
	  </li>

	  <dt><font color="red">Calcium</font></dt>
          <li><b>Ca</b> : no explanation provided.  This was assigned a mass appropriate for calcium and 
	    I suspect it is intended for Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion.</li>

	  <dt><font color="red">Carbon</font></dt>
          <li><b>c</b> : carbon (sp<sup>3</sup>) in alkanes</li>
          <li><b>c"</b> : carbonyl carbon except in amides.  Be sure that you are surrounding this atom type with 
	    single quotes in towhee_input as using double quotes will cause a read error for <b>c"</b></li>
          <li><b>c`</b> : carbonyl carbon in amides (connected to nitrogen).  This is listed as <b>c'</b> in their 
	    work, but is implemented using the alternate style of single quote in order to avoid problems reading 
	    character strings surrounded by the typical Fortran single quotes.
	  </li>
          <li><b>c+</b> : triply connected carbon in amidine and imidazole cations.</li>
          <li><b>c-</b> : carbon in carboxylate groups</li>
          <li><b>c=</b> : carbon (sp<sup>2</sup>) in alkenes.  This atom type was erronously listed as <b>c</b> in
	    the supplementary information so some inference was required in order to determine which parameters 
	    belong to <b>c=</b> instead of <b>c</b>.  See the Typos and Comments section above for a complete 
	    list of inferred parameters for this atom type.
	  </li>
          <li><b>co</b> : anomeric carbon in acetals and hemiacetals.</li>
          <li><b>cp</b> : carbon in aromatic rings.</li>
          <li><b>cpb</b> : bridging carbon in bridged aromatics</li>
          <li><b>cr</b> : no explanation provided.  This was assigned a mass appropriate for carbon and I suspect 
	    it is some form of bonded carbon.  The only other parameters provided for this type are bond increment 
	    values with a few forms of nitrogen so this is probably not useful as implemented into Towhee.
	  </li>
          <li><b>ct</b> : carbon (sp) in alkynes.</li>

	  <dt><font color="red">Chlorine</font></dt>
          <li><b>Cl</b> : no explanation provided.  This was assigned a mass appropriate for chlorine and 
	    I suspect it is intended for Cl<sup>-</sup> ion.</li>
          <li><b>cl</b> : chlorine.  This appears to be intended for use when bonded to other atoms.</li>

	  <dt><font color="red">Cesium</font></dt>
          <li><b>Cs</b> : no explanation provided.  This was assigned a mass appropriate for cesium and 
	    I suspect it is intended for Cs<sup>+</sup> ion.</li>

	  <dt><font color="red">Copper</font></dt>
          <li><b>Cu</b> : no explanation provided.  This was assigned a mass appropriate for copper and 
	    I suspect it is intended for a Cu ion, but I am not sure of the charge state.</li>

	  <dt><font color="red">Fluorine</font></dt>
          <li><b>F</b> : no explanation provided.  This was assigned a mass appropriate for fluorine and
	    I suspect it is intended for F<sup>-</sup> ion.</li>
          <li><b>f</b> : fluorine.  This appears to be intended for use when bonded to other atoms.</li>

	  <dt><font color="red">Hydrogen</font></dt>
          <li><b>h</b> : hydrogen connected to carbon or sulfur.</li>
          <li><b>h*</b> : hydrogen connected to oxygen or nitrogen (except in ammonium).  This atom type was
	    erroneously listed as <b>h</b> in the supplementary information so some inference was required in order
	    to determine which parameters belong to <b>h*</b> insteda of <b>h</b>.  See the Typos and Comments 
	    section above for a complete list of inferred parameters for this atom type.</li>
          <li><b>h+</b> : hydrogen in ammonium groups.</li>

	  <dt><font color="red">Iron</font></dt>
          <li><b>Fe</b> : no explanation provided.  This was assigned  a mass appropriate for iron and 
	    I suspect it is intended for an Fe ion, but I am not sure of the charge state.</li>

	  <dt><font color="red">Iodine</font></dt>
          <li><b>I</b> : no explanation provided.  This was assigned a mass appropriate for iodine and
	    I suspect it is intended for I<sup>-</sup> ion.</li>
          <li><b>i</b> : no explanation provided.  This was assigned a mass appropriate for iodine and I suspect
	    it is intended for iodine bonded to another atom.  Unforunately the only other parameters provided for
	    this atom type are bond increments so this is probably not useful as implemented into Towhee.
	  </li>

	  <dt><font color="red">Potassium</font></dt>
          <li><b>K</b> : no explanation provided.  This was assigned a mass appropriate for potassium and 
	    I suspect it is intended for K<sup>+</sup> ion.</li>

	  <dt><font color="red">Lithium</font></dt>
          <li><b>Li</b> : no explanation provided.  This was assigned a mass appropriate for lithium and 
	    I suspect it is intended for Li<sup>+</sup> ion.</li>

	  <dt><font color="red">Magnesium</font></dt>
          <li><b>Mg</b> : no explanation provided.  This was assigned a mass appropriate for magnesium and 
	    I suspect it is intended for Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion.</li>

	  <dt><font color="red">Nitrogen</font></dt>
          <li><b>n</b> : nitrogen in amides and amidines</li>
          <li><b>n`</b> : nitrogen in nitro groups.  This is listed as <b>n'</b> in their 
	    work, but is implemented using the alternate style of single quote in order to avoid problems reading 
	    character strings surrounded by the typical Fortran single quotes.
	  </li>
          <li><b>n+</b> : nitrogen in ammonium groups.</li>
          <li><b>n=</b> : doubly bonded nitrogen.  This atom type was erronously listed as <b>n</b> in
	    the supplementary information so some inference was required in order to determine which parameters 
	    belong to <b>n=</b> instead of <b>n</b>.  See the Typos and Comments section above for a complete 
	    list of inferred parameters for this atom type.
	  </li>
          <li><b>na</b> : nitrogen (sp<sup>3</sup>) in amines</li>
          <li><b>nh</b> : nitrogen (sp<sup>2</sup>) triply connected in five- and six-membered rings (e.g. pyrrole)</li>
          <li><b>nn</b> : nitrogen (sp<sup>2</sup>) connected to aromatic rings (e.g. aniline)</li>
          <li><b>np</b> : nitrogen (sp<sup>2</sup>) doubly connected in five- and six-membered rings (e.g. pyridine)</li>

	  <dt><font color="red">Oxygen</font></dt>
          <li><b>o</b> : doubly connected oxygen</li>
          <li><b>o`</b> : carbonyl and sulfonyl oxygen.  This is listed as <b>o'</b> in their 
	    work, but is implemented using the alternate style of single quote in order to avoid problems reading 
	    character strings surrounded by the typical Fortran single quotes.
	  </li>
	  <li><b>o-</b> : oxygen in carboxylates, dialkyl phosphaes, and phosphate dianions</li>
          <li><b>op</b> : oxygen in aromatic rings</li>
          <li><b>o?</b> : no explanation provided.  There are several instances of duplicate oxygen parameters and 
	    I suspect it is an additional unpublished oxygen value that got mixed up with the normal <b>o</b> in
	    the formatting problems.  I have given it the <b>o?</b> name and included it in case anyone knows 
	    its true purpose.
	  </li>

	  <dt><font color="red">Phosphorus</font></dt>
          <li><b>p</b> : phosphorus in dialkyl phosphates</li>
          <li><b>p-</b> : phosphorus in phosphate dianions</li>

	  <dt><font color="red">Sodium</font></dt>
          <li><b>Na</b> : no explanation provided.  This was assigned a mass appropriate for sodium and 
	    I suspect it is intended for Na<sup>+</sup> ion.</li>

	  <dt><font color="red">Sulfur</font></dt>
          <li><b>s</b> : sulfur (sp<sup>3</sup>) doubly connected</li>
          <li><b>s"</b> : sulfur in solfones and solfonamides.  Be sure that you are surrounding this atom type with 
	    single quotes in towhee_input as using double quotes will cause a read error for <b>s"</b></li>
          <li><b>sp</b> : sulfur in aromatic rings</li>

	  <dt><font color="red">Rubidium</font></dt>
          <li><b>Rb</b> : no explanation provided.  This was assigned a mass appropriate for rubidium and 
	    I suspect it is intended for Mg<sup>+</sup> ion.</li>

	  <dt><font color="red">Zinc</font></dt>
          <li><b>Zn</b> : no explanation provided.  This was assigned a mass appropriate for zinc and
	    I suspect it is intended for a Zn ion, but am not sure of the charge state.</li>
