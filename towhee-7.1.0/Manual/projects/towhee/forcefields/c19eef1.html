      <ul>
        This section covers the C19eef1 force field (which is a
	modified version of Charmm19 that includes the EEF1 implicit
	solvent model) as it is implemented into the towhee_ff_c19eef1
	file in the ForceFields directory.  All of the Towhee atom
	types for the C19eef1 force field are listed, along with a
	short description of their meanings.  Note that Charmm19 is a
	'12-6 plus solvation' classical_potential with 'explicit' classical_mixrule
	so it cannot currently be combined with any other forcefields.  The implicit 
	water solvation is toggled on and off using the <b>isolvtype</b>
	variable in the towhee_input file.  Any
	discrepencies (especially typos) from the published C19eef1
	force field values are the sole responsibility of Marcus
	G. Martin, and I welcome feedback on how this implementation
	compares with other programs.  <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </ul>

      <b>C19eef1 in Towhee</b> 
      <ul>
        The official force field name for C19eef1 in Towhee is 'C19eef1'.  Here I list all of 
	the C19eef1 atom names for use in the towhee_input file, along with a brief description.  C19eef1 
	denotes extended-atom for cases where the hydrogens and the heavy element they are bonded to are all 
	lumped into a single interaction site.

	Please note that the capitalization and spacing pattern is important 
	and must be followed exactly as listed here.  I include the atom notes from the Neria paper.

      <b>Coulombic Interactions</b> 
      <ul>
        C19eef1 utilizes point charges on atomic centers to represent the charge distribution on a molecule.  As far as I know,
	there is no automated system for assigning the charges in C19eef1.  However, C19eef1 uses a neutral group approach for 
	most moities found in organic molecules.  The charge distibution is similiar to that used in Charmm19, except the ionic side 
	chain amino acids are neutralized, and the specifics on how to do this can be found in Lazaridis and Karplus 1999.  
	Otherwise, it is fairly easy to scan through the example molecular charge distributions found in the files available at the 
	<a href="http://www.pharmacy.umaryland.edu/faculty/amackere/">MacKerell research web site</a> and determine 
	what charges to apply to the molecule you wish to simulate.

      </ul>
      <b>Improper torsions</b> 
      <ul>
        Improper torsions are not automatically generated by the
        Towhee code as the rules for determining where they are
        applied are not always straight-forward.  C19eef1 exclusively
        uses the out-of-plane version of the improper torsions, and
        they are typically centered on an sp<sup>2</sup> atom in order
        to enforce planarity with its three neighbors.  These torsions
        are listed in the C19eef1 literature as i-j-k-l where the
        angle is the dihedral between i-j-k and j-k-l.  The bonding
        pattern is not completely clear to me, but it appears that
        either i or l is the central atom which is bonded to all three
        of the other atoms, and none of the other three atoms are
        bonded to each other.  In the towhee_input file the improper
        torsions is listed starting from the central atom and the
        three other atoms are listed in the same order as C19eef1.
        So, if the central atom is i, then the atoms are listed j, k,
        l.  If the central atom is l then the atoms are listed k, j,
        i.  Remember that you can set the improper type to 0 to have
        the code automatically determine the improper type (so long as
        inpstyle is 2).
      </ul>

      <b>Proteins</b> 
      <ul>
        All of the 20 basic amino acids (including the 3 forms of hystidine)
	are functional for the C19eef1 force field. I have implemented the atom types and charges according to the published 
	Ch19eef1 values.  Below is a complete list of the codes for the 20 amino acids, plus some other functional groups that 
	work with the protein builder.  C19eef1 does not apply a torsion across all set of atoms connected by 3 bonds 
	in the amino acids.  The torsions are explicitly listed for these systems in the polyc19eef1.F routine.  I tried 
	to faithfully reproduce all of their energetics, but had to make some accomodations for tryptophan.  They have 
	two torsions in tryptophan that span atoms that are not bonded together and I could not implement those into 
	Towhee without a major reworking of configuartional-bias.
