      <ul>
        This section covers the NERD Version 1 United Atom (NERDv1) force field as it is implemented into 
	the towhee_ff_NERDv1 file in the ForceFields directory.  The NERD force field has had several minor 
	changes to parameters as time as progresses so I have broken each of these changes into a different 
	version of the force field.  NERD Version 1 is mostly a subset of NERD Version 2, with the exception 
	that the linear alkane torsional potential is slightly different between the two versions.  
	All of the Towhee atom types for this force 
	field are listed, along with a short description of their meanings.
	Note that NERDv1 is a Lennard-Jones (12-6) force field and can only be combined with
	other Lennard-Jones (12-6) force fields.  I would like to thank Nicholas du Preez for initiating 
	the implementation of this force field into Towhee.
	Any discrepencies (especially typos) from the published values are the sole responsibility
	of Marcus G. Martin, and I welcome feedback on how this implementation compares
	with other programs.

      <b>References for NERD Version 1</b> 
      <ul>
        What I term NERD Version 1 is described in two papers.

      <b>NERDv1 in Towhee</b> 
      <ul>
        The official force field name for NERD Version 1 United Atom in Towhee is 'NERDv1'.  Here I list all of 
	the atom names for use in the towhee_input file, along with a brief description.  I created these
	atom names in order to work with the molecule assembler.  NERDv1 is a united-atom force field which lumps
	hydrogens onto their neighboring carbons.  Note that hydrogens that are bonded to atoms other than carbon
	are not lumped onto their neighboring atoms.  The general pattern of the names is a list of the atoms that 
	make up the group, followed by the hybridization of the central atom, and ending in a character string that 
	distinguishes similar atoms.
	
	Please note that the capitalization and spacing pattern is important 
	and must be followed exactly as listed here.
	<ul>
          <li><b>'CH3sp3eth'</b> : sp<sup>3</sup> carbon plus the 3 hydrogens bonded to it (united-atom) in ethane.</li>
          <li><b>'CH3sp3pro'</b> : sp<sup>3</sup> carbon plus the 3 hydrogens bonded to it (united-atom) in propane.</li>
          <li><b>'CH3sp3isob'</b> : sp<sup>3</sup> carbon plus the 3 hydrogens bonded to it (united-atom) in isobutane.</li>
          <li><b>'CH3sp32mb'</b> : sp<sup>3</sup> carbon plus the 3 hydrogens bonded to it (united-atom) bonded to 
	  a CH group in 2-methylbutane.</li>
          <li><b>'CH3sp3mesc'</b> : sp<sup>3</sup> carbon plus the 3 hydrogens bonded to it (united-atom) bonded to 
	  a CH group (methyl side-chain) and not a special case listed above.</li>
          <li><b>'CH3sp3etsc'</b> : sp<sup>3</sup> carbon plus the 3 hydrogens bonded to it (united-atom) bonded to 
	  a CH<sub>2</sub> group that is itself bonded to a CH group (ethyl side-chain).</li>
          <li><b>'CH3sp3gen'</b> : sp<sup>3</sup> carbon plus the 3 hydrogens bonded to it (united-atom) and not one 
	  of the cases listed above.</li>
          <li><b>'CH2sp3'</b> : sp<sup>3</sup> carbon plus the 2 hydrogens bonded to it (united-atom).</li>
          <li><b>'CHsp3'</b> : sp<sup>3</sup> carbon plus the 1 hydrogen bonded to it (united-atom).</li>
          <li><b>'CH2sp2eth'</b> : sp<sup>2</sup> carbon plus the 2 hydrogens bonded to it (united-atom) in ethene.</li>
	</ul>
      </ul>
      <b>Coulombic interactions</b> 
      <ul>
        There are no coulombic interactions used in NERDv1, although there are some in subsequent versions of NERD.
      </ul>
      <b>Improper torsions</b> 
      <ul>
        This force field does not utilize improper torsions.
      </ul>
      <b>Proteins</b> 
      <ul>
        This force field does not have all of the groups needed for protein simulations.
      </ul>
