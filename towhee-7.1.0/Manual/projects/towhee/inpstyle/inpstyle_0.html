     This section describes the input variables associated with an <b>input_style</b> setting of 'explicit'.  
     Requires explicit declaration of all terms of the force field that describes this molecule type. This is most difficult way to set up the molecule
     information, but it also allows the most flexibility.
     This option is only recommended when it is not possible to use the more sophisticated options to set up the molecule of interest.

     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <dt><a name="nunit"><b>nunit (integer)</b></a>
      <ul>
       <li> The number of atoms (or united-atoms) in this molecule. Must be less than or equal to NUMAX
        (see <a href="../code/code_manual.html#preproc">preproc.h</a>).
       </li>
      </ul>
     </dt>

     <dt><a name="nmaxcbmc"><b>nmaxcbmc (integer)</b></a> 
      <ul>
       <li> The maximum number of atoms to regrow during a <a href="../code/cbmc.html">configurational-bias</a> regrowth.</li>
      </ul>
     </dt>

     <dt><a name="lpdbnames"><b>lpdbnames (logical)</b></a>
      <ul>
       <li>.TRUE. : to enable the input of information about the pdb (protein data bank) atom name, amino acid number, amino acid name. This 
        information is needed in order to use the cartoon feature of certain pdb viewers (such as <a href="../software.html#rasmol">Rasmol</a>).
       </li>
       <li>.FALSE. : to disable the input of additional pdb information.  This does not disable the output of pdb files, it just means thing like 
        the <a href="../software.html#rasmol">Rasmol</a> cartoon feature will not work properly.
       </li>
      </ul>
     </dt>

     <p></p>
     <font color="red"> The variables listed immediately below (unit through improper) are listed as a group for each atom in the molecule. 
      These are repeated one time for each atom in the molecule.  Thus, you input all of the information about the first atom before you list information
      for the subsequent atoms.
     </font> 

     <dt><a name="unit"><b>unit (integer), ntype (integer), qqatom (double precision)</b></a>
      <ul>
       <li> unit is the number of the atom in order starting from atom number 1. This is only used to help the user keep track of the 
        molecule as they are building it in the input file. If the unit number listed in towhee_input does not match the running total 
        of unit numbers in Towhee then the code will stop with an error message.
       </li>
       <li> ntype is the integer used to determine the force field parameters. You will need to look in the towhee_ff_xxx force field 
        files you are utilizing in order to find the number that you wish to use.
       </li>
       <li> qqatom is the charge on this atom.</li>
      </ul>
     </dt>

     <dt><a name="pdbname"><b>pdbname (character), aminonum (integer), aminoshort (character)</b></a>
      <dt>Note: These variables only need to be listed if lpdbnames = .true.</dt>
      <ul>
       <li> pdbname: A four letter/number string that is output in the pdb file. The precise spacing is important if you want to get most pdb 
        viewers to recognize the atoms as the pdb file is extremely specific.
       </li>
       <li> aminonum: The number of each amino acid starting from the N-terminus.</li>
       <li> aminoshort: The three letter code for each amino acid, or other group (such as caps on the C or N termini).</li>
      </ul>
     </dt>

     <dt><b>vibration</b> 
      <ul>
       <dt><a name="invib"><b>invib (integer)</b></a>
        <ul>
         <li> The first line under the vibration heading is the number of atoms that are bonded to the current atom. Must be a number between 
          0 and NNBOND (see <a href="../code/code_manual.html#preproc">preproc.h</a>).
         </li>
        </ul>
       </dt>

       <dt><a name="ijvib"><b>ijvib (integer), itvib (integer)</b></a>
        <ul>
         <li> The next <b>invib</b> lines underneath the vibration heading are a list of the bond partner and bond force field number for the
          <b>invib</b> atoms that are bonded to the current atom. Thus if you have 4 vibrations the next 4 lines will list the bond partner and bond
          force field number for each bond.
         </li>
        </ul>
       </dt>

     <dt><b>bending</b> 
      <ul>
       <dt><a name="inben"><b>inben (integer)</b></a> 
        <ul>
         <li> The first line under the bending heading is the number of bond bending angles that terminate at the current atom. You must list 
          all bond bending angles which have the current atom at one of the ends, but you do not list bond bending angles which contain 
          the current atom in the center. Must be a number between 0 and MAXBEND (see <a href="../code/code_manual.html#preproc">preproc.h</a>).
         </li>
        </ul>
       </dt>

       <dt><a name="ijben2"><b>ijben2 (integer), ijben3(integer), itben (integer), orderben (integer)</b></a>
        <ul>
         <li> The next <b>inben</b> lines underneath the bending heading are a list of the other atoms in the bond bending angle and the bond bending angle
          force field number for the <b>inben</b> angles that contain the current atom at one of the ends. The format for listing the angle is to consider 
          the current atom in the first position of an angle between atoms current-ijben2-ijben3 so you only need to list atoms ijben2 and ijben3, the
          bending type, and the bending order on each line, where there is one angle per line of towhee_input.  The bending order is only used for force
          fields that have parameters that depend upon the order of the three atoms in the bond - typically those that have class 2 cross terms.
          Valid entries for the bending order are
          <ul>
           <li>1 : the atoms in the bending angle force field are in the same order as the atoms listed here</li>
	   <li>-1 : the atoms in the bending angle force field are in the reverse order compared to the atoms listed here</li>
           <li>0 : null entry to make it easy for those force fields that do not depend upon the bending order</li>
          </ul>
         </li>
        </ul>
       </dt>

     <dt><b>torsion</b> 
      <ul>
       <dt><a name="intor"><b>intor (integer)</b></a>
        <ul>
         <li> The first line under the torsion heading is the number of dihedral angles (regular torsions) that terminate at the current atom. 
          You must list all regular torsion angles which have the current atom at one of the ends, but you do not list regular torsion angles 
          which contain the current atom in the center. Must be a number between 0 and MAXTOR 
          (see <a href="../code/code_manual.html#preproc">preproc.h</a>).
         </li>
        </ul>
       </dt>

       <dt><a name="ijtor2"><b>ijtor2 (integer), ijtor3(integer), ijtor4 (integer), ittor (integer)</b></a>
        <ul>
         <li> The next <b>intor</b> lines underneath the torsion heading are a list of the other atoms in the regular torsion angle and the torsion force
          field number for the <b>intor</b> torsions that contain the current atom at one of the ends. The format for listing the regular
          torsion angle is to consider the current atom in the first position of a dihedral between atoms current-ijtor2-ijtor3-ijtor4 so you only need
          to list atoms ijtor2, ijtor3, and ijtor4 and the torsion type on each line, where there is one regular torsion per line of towhee_input.
         </li>
        </ul>
       </dt>
      </ul>
     </dt>

     <dt><b>angle-angle</b> 
      <ul>
       <dt><a name="inaa"><b>inaa (integer)</b></a>
        <ul>
         <li> The first line under the angle-angle heading is the number of angle-angle terms which have their shared central atom located 
          at the current atom. You must list all angle-angle terms which have the current atom at the shared central position, but you do not list
          angle-angle terms which contain the current atom at one of the ends. Must be a number between 0 and MAXAA
          (see <a href="../code/code_manual.html#preproc">preproc.h</a>).
         </li>
        </ul>
       </dt>

       <dt><a name="ijaa0"><b>ijaa0 (integer), ijaa1(integer), ijaa2 (integer), itaa (integer)</b></a>
        <ul>
         <li> The next <b>inaa</b> lines underneath the angle-angle heading are a list of the other atoms in the angle-angle term and and the angle-angle
          force field number for the <b>inaa</b> angle-angle terms that contain the current atom at the shared central atom. The format for listing the
          regular torsion angle is to consider the current atom as the central shared atom in the angle-angle term between the angles ijaa0-current-ijaa1 
          and ijaa0-current-ijaa2. Each angle-angle term is listed on one line according to the format ijaa0, ijaa1, ijaa2 and itaa (the angle-angle type).
         </li>
        </ul>
       </dt>

     <dt><b>improper torsion</b> 
      <ul>
       <dt><a name="inimp"><b>inimprop (integer)</b></a>
        <ul>
         <li> The first line under the improper heading is the number of improper torsions (any form) which have the central atom located at the current atom.
          You must list all improper torsions which have the current atom at the central position, but you do not list improper torsions which contain 
          the current atom at one of the ends. Must be a number between 0 and MAXIMPROP (see <a href="../code/code_manual.html#preproc">preproc.h</a>).
         </li>
        </ul>
       </dt>

       <dt><a name="ijimprop2"><b>ijimprop2 (integer), ijimprop3(integer), ijimprop4 (integer), itimprop (integer)</b></a>
        <ul>
         <li> The next <b>inimprop</b> lines underneath the improper torsion heading are a list of the other atoms in the improper torsion and the
          improper force field number for the <b>inimprop</b> improper torsions that contain the current atom at the central atom.  There are currently
          three different forms of improper torsions, and these forms are specified in the force field files.  In all cases, the three atoms must be bonded
          to the current atom.
