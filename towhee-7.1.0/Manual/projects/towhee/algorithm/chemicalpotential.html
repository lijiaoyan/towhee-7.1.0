      <li><b>WARNING</b> The treatment of normalization constants for rigid bonds and rigid angles changed yet again in version 6.2.10.  Recomputing the
       chemical potential for such molecules is required when comparing between versions.
      </li>
      <li><b>WARNING</b> Prior to the 6.0.4 release the treatment of some normalization constants for rigid bond and angles was different.  Chemical
       potentials for molecules with rigid bonds or angles computed in earlier versions are going to give a different result in newer versions.  This is
       usually just a constant shift so a quick recalculation of the chemical potential is advised before using old values in a new Grand Canonical 
       simulation.
      </li>
      <li><b>WARNING</b> Prior to the 4.5.2 release all chemical potentials (except the Gibbs total chemical potential) were defined differently than
       documented here.
     </ul>
     <b>Chemical Potential Definitions</b>
     <ul>
      There are several different types of chemical potential output by the Towhee program.
      The various chemical potentials reported by the code are listed and defined in this essay.
      Consider the following equation as a starting point.
      <ul>&mu;<sub>total</sub>(i) = &mu;<sub>residual</sub>(i) + &mu;<sub>density</sub>(i) 
       + &mu;<sub>isolation</sub>(i)
      </ul>
      &mu;<sub>total</sub>(i) is the total chemical potential of molecule <b>i</b> and is the appropriate value to 
      consider when looking for total free energies of a system.  This total chemical potential is then commonly broken 
      down into several subcomponents either for computational convenience, or because the subcomponents relate to 
      certain thermodynamic quantities.  Towhee defines, and calculates, these subcomponents as follows.</dt>
      <li>
       The total Gibbs chemical potential is computed using the insertion Rosenbluth weight (containing all interactions - intermolecular and intramolecular)
       and is computed each time a multi-box swap move is attempted, and also <b>chempotperstep</b> times at the end of every Monte Carlo cycle.
       <ul>&mu;<sub>total</sub>(i) = - k<sub>B</sub> T ln[ < W * V / ( [N(i)+1] * &Lambda;<sup>3</sup>(i) ) > ]</ul>
       where <b>k<sub>B</sub></b> is Boltzmann's constant, <b>T</b> is the temperature, <b>V</b> is the volume of the simulation box, 
       <b>N(i)</b> is the number of molecules of type <b>i</b> in the simulation box, and <b>&Lambda;(i)</b> is the 
       thermal de Broglie wavelength for molecule type <b>i</b>.  The < > brackets indicate an ensemble average of the quantity inside the brackets.
      </li>
      <li>
       The ideal density dependent portion of the chemical potential is
       <ul>&mu;<sub>density</sub>(i) = - k<sub>B</sub> T ln[ < V / N(i) > / &Lambda;<sup>3</sup>(i)) ]</ul>
      </li>
      <li>
       The isolated molecule portion of the chemical potential is the non-density dependent chemical potential of an isolated molecule in an ideal gas
       (which means it does not interact with any other molecule, but does interact with itself).  This quantity is not normally computed by Towhee.  
       However, this is computed in the special case where the total number of molecules (<b>nmolectyp</b>) of one of the species is set 
       to zero.  In that case, the isolated molecule chemical potential is computed <b>chempotperstep</b> times per cycle.  It uses the full Rosenbluth
       weight (<b>W</b>) computed for growing the molecule in an extremely large box that has the Ewald sum and the van der Waals tail corrections disabled.
       This uses the standard formula for computing the chemical potential via configurational-bias.
       <ul>&mu;<sub>isolation</sub>(i) = -k<sub>B</sub> T ln[ < W<sub>isolation</sub> > ].</ul>
      </li>
      <li>
       The NVT insertion chemical potential is computed in a very similar manner as the Gibbs total chemical potential.  The only difference is the lack of
       any number density terms in the average.  This chemical potential calculation is only formally correct for a single box canonical ensemble.  However,
       experience has shown that this chemical potential is often better when the average number of molecules of the type of interest drops below 1.  It turns
       out that systematic errors in the number density term from using the Gibbs total chemical potential (essentially the use of N+1) are significant in
       this case.  This is discussed further in <a href="../references.html#martin_siepmann_1998_tca">Martin and Siepmann 1998 (TCA)</a>.
       <ul>&mu;<sub>NVT Insertion</sub>(i) = - k<sub>B</sub> T ln[ < W > ]</ul>
      </li>
      <li>
       The NpT insertion chemical potential is computed in a very similar manner as the NVT insertion chemical potential.  The only difference is the
       inclusion of a volume term in the average, that is then removed later by dividing out the average volume.  This chemical potential calculation is
       only formally correct for a single box isobaric-isothermal ensemble.  However, experience has shown that this chemical potential is often better when
       the average number of molecules of the type of interest drops below 1.  It turns out that systematic errors in the number density term from using the
       Gibbs total chemical potential (essentially the use of N+1) are significant in this case.  This is discussed further in 
       <a href="../references.html#martin_siepmann_1998_tca">Martin and Siepmann 1998 (TCA)</a>.
       <ul>&mu;<sub>NpT Insertion</sub>(i) = - k<sub>B</sub> T ln[ < V W > / < V > ]</ul>
      </li>
      <li>
       The residual chemical potential is not computed directly in Towhee.  Instead it is inferred by computing the full insertion chemical potential and
       then substracting the isolated molecule chemical potential.  This chemical potential is only computed in the special case when we are interested in
       Henry's Law coefficients and <b>nmolectyp</b> is set to 0 for at least one of the components.  The residual chemical potential is 
       computed in two slightly different ways depening on the ensemble.  If we are using the canonical ensemble then the residual chemical potential is
       <ul>&mu;<sub>residual</sub>(i) = &mu;<sub>NVT Insertion</sub>(i) - &mu;<sub>Isolation</sub>(i)</ul>
       and if we are using the isobaric-isothermal ensemble (the typical ensemble for computing Henry's law) then the residual chemical potential is
       <ul>&mu;<sub>residual</sub>(i) = &mu;<sub>NpT Insertion</sub>(i) - &mu;<sub>Isolation</sub>(i).</ul>
      </li>
