README.histogram
The files included in the Phase, PVT, and Weights subdirectories show sample 
input files that are required for the different functions (phase coexistence,
pvt, and histogram reweighting calculations) which are included
in the analyse_histogram.F code.  These files are included so that the user 
can see sample input scripts when making their own.  The only other files
that will be required will be the histograms themselves, which are output
by Towhee.  The histograms are not included in these examples due to the
very large file sizes.
